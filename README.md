## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  I had some trouble implementing the Logout button as I originally thought I had to send an empty user back to the login screen as there was a weird error where I couldn't login to another account after logging out. However, it seems that it was just a small bug or glitch in the code. Overall it was a fun project especially with creating the backend in Back4App.
